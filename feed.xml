A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K4YcaU5uqU&quot;&gt;2016 TEDx talk&lt;/a&gt; by futurist Stephan Schwartz and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjYrxcGSWX4&quot;&gt;2019 TED talk&lt;/a&gt; by author Tim Harford. While Stephan Schwartz presents a process divided into six steps to induce creativity, Tim Harford shows a different method, much more diverse in approach. Comparing both processes, they seem conflicting; however, when analysing more closely, they complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwartz argues that by looking at the diaries of other creative genii from the past, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Picasso, Einstein, Pauli, Planck, etc., to understand how they managed to produce so much stuff, we can distil it to a six-step process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Master your craft. After you master your art, you can honestly evaluate what you’re doing and correct the course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a deep conviction that there’s a solution to what you’re working on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surrender your preconceptions and biases. Even scientists value peer status more than facts, don’t do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look inside yourself, or inward-looking-ness, as Stephan Schwartz puts it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Non-local consciousness. Intention, focus and awareness lead to the eureka moment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have the ability to translate insights and replicate them to share with others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth item mentions focus; what does it mean? Does it mean sitting down and working on only one task at a time? Or does it mean focusing in a more general way, attacking one problem at a time until you solve it, which can take years? When we look at the second step, we’re induced to solve one problem: the focus mentioned in the fifth step. Nonetheless, let’s take a look at a different approach on how to work with multiple projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Harford argues that top scientists work on many problems simultaneously, in what he calls slow-motion multitasking, &lt;em&gt;“the act of starting multiple projects and switching between them as needed.”&lt;/em&gt; Looking at top scientists and their first 100 published papers, they switched topics 43 times on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does context switching help? Tim mentions three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creativity happens when you take an idea and move it to a different context. As he puts it, when you’re constantly switching boxes, it’s easier to think outside the box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning to do something well can often help you do something else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you get stuck on one problem, you can use it as an opportunity to work on something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t sound easy to manage many projects at the same time. But with the proper process, it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t sound easy to manage many projects simultaneously, but with the proper process, it’s possible. Niklas Luhmann did exactly that with his zettelkasten. Although Luhmann had one big project, that project could be split into many small projects (e.g., his myriad of books and articles). In his own words, &lt;em&gt;“I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it; if I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”&lt;/em&gt; If it’s not straightforward, he finds something else to do until the first task becomes easy. American choreographer Twyla Tharp gives each of her projects a big cardboard box. She tosses into each box anything that can be a source of inspiration for that project. According to her:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The box means I never have to worry about forgetting. One of the biggest fears for a creative person is that some brilliant idea will get lost because you didn’t write it down and put it in a safe place. I don’t worry about that. Because I know where to find it. It’s all in the box.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the focus step mentioned in the first video. What do I understand by that? When you sit down to work, focus on work. Do not get distracted by random browsing, social media, memes or cat videos. But do not be tied to only one problem if that means halting progress when stuck. Think about other issues, jump between boxes, you may find unexpected connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is more about the journey than inspiration. By finding the process that works for you, you can foster your inventiveness and bring your ideas to life. And by looking at proven methods of great minds, you have a starting point for your own.&lt;/p&gt;

And you
ended up with too many ideas that you had to aggressively trim down or, worse,
you solved the wrong problem? Opportunity Solution Tree may help you avoid
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunity Solution Tree (let’s shorten it to OST) is a visual way to
represent how the solutions connect to the desired outcome in a way that helps
you focus on solving the right problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can build an OST in 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Identify the outcome, e.g., a metric you want to improve. Example: improve
engagement on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find opportunities related to your desired outcome. Example: build
relationships with other creators.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brainstorm the solutions with one condition: the solutions should always be
linked to one of the opportunities from the previous step. Example: comment
on other people’s tweets. An example of what not to do: start another
account in another social network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Define experiments to validate your hypothesis. Example: engage with at
least 3 other creators per day for two weeks and compare how received likes,
retweets and followers changed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that in step 2 you may find more than one opportunity, thus in step 3
you create solutions for several opportunities, increase the options to
multi-track, i.e., act on more than one opportunity at a time. You don’t fixate
on one opportunity. However, you’re always connected to your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reframing the ideation process using the OST framework allow you to find
solutions without going off course or creating too much noise. Give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

my job better. He referred me to a book, Extreme Ownership, by Jocko Willink
and Leif Babin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book’s main idea is to take ownership of everything you do (or don’t do),
especially for a leader. If a team fails, the leader should step up and
assume the failure instead of blaming the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this idea is relevant for individual contributors too. Instead of blaming
others, look at what you could have done better to prevent the situation.
Instead of “the budget approved by C-level wasn’t reasonable”, think of “what
can I do with this budget and how can I bring visibility of possible
shortcomings?” Instead of “the tasks are not well described”, think of “what
questions can I ask to clarify the requirements?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when a problem arises, do not point fingers. Assume the failure, learn
from it and create an action plan to do better next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme ownership is not an excuse to be dumb, though. If you’re innocent,
don’t take the blame for something illegal. Those infringing the law must
face the consequences, not you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you face an issue, instead of pointing fingers, try this exercise:
ask yourself, “what could I have done to prevent this?” And act on the
conclusion. You’ll notice that, after a while, you’ll earn more trust from
your team, peers and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I watched a YouTube video from Ted Vieira, a well-known photographer among the Fujifilm community, titled Gear With Soul? He shows a magazine by KEH Camera with the tagline “Gear with soul for people with vision” and spends the video showing photos and talking about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an old video from DigitalRev TV where Kai Wong discusses what makes a Leica M unique. And the very last line is “it got soul.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember being in a workshop and the instructor badmouthing Sony cameras saying “they have no soul”. A friend of mine joked “of course not, they are cameras!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some people say that some objects have souls? I have seen this also happening in motorcycle community and I found a pattern. Beware this is not a scientific study, everything is based only on anecdotal evidence. Both in motorcycle and photography community, it’s usually related to old or at least old-style cameras or motorcycles. It makes me wonder if it’s just a nostalgic feeling for people who lived in a bygone era or younger people who wished to live in that era or just people running away from the day-to-day rush and those objects remind them of a slow-paced time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s just baloney, but if you feel inspired by that, go ahead. Enjoy the way the camera feels in your hands, the lens, moving the focusing tab. Pretend you’re Sebastião Salgado, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and go have fun with your camera. Who knows what kind of photography you’ll get in those unpretentious moments.&lt;/p&gt;

Megginson in 1963).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That quote refers to the evolution of the species, but we can bring it to the corporate environment, especially in the startup world. Companies pivot. Companies fail. Companies merge and get acquired—the culture of the company changes. For better or for worse, but it won’t stay the same. Some people can’t accept that. It’s ok to dislike the change and move to another company. People have different preferences and are suited to different environments. But if you’re resilient and can bear with the change, it can be an excellent opportunity to grow in your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to perform well when everything is going well but harder to stick out because everyone is doing alright. On the other hand, when the company is going through change, and people start to complain, just show up and work. Of course, you can complain about the problems but use the proper channels. Chances are, your manager is also trying to avoid the dismantling of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you survive those challenging moments, you’re seen as reliable and may be assigned more responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that the only way to grow or get more responsibilities? No. Are you wrong if you leave? Definitely no. No company is worth your mental health, and if it’s terrible for you, move on. Be true to yourself. You’re not better or worse if you stay or if you go. But while you’re there, do your best and try to get the best from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s start discussing trust and then how to conduct one-on-one meetings to earn that trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;Trust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2021/01/mistrust/&quot;&gt;The High Price of Mistrust&lt;/a&gt;, a book titled Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, is discussed and there are two parts I’d like to quote as they relate to remote management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“One key lesson we can derive from Bowling Alone is that the less we trust each other—something which is both a cause and consequence of declining community engagement—the more it costs us.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Mistrust drives us to install remote monitoring software on our employees’ laptops and ask them to fill in reports on every tiny task to prove they’re not skiving off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surveillance is an attempt to control the team. That’s the wrong premise, you don’t have to control the team, you have to build trust, provide directions and trust the team will do the right thing. And to build trust, first you start building relationships. But how to do that without face-to-face interactions like you had at the office? One-on-one meetings are the key to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-one-on-one-meetings&quot;&gt;Why one-on-one meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Google, it was believed that to be a good engineering manager, having deeper technical expertise than the team was needed. Still, what they found through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/business/13hire.html&quot;&gt;Project Oxygen&lt;/a&gt;, a 2009 manager research project, was that the most valued managers were the ones who made time for one-on-one meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://knowyourteam.com/&quot;&gt;Know Your Team&lt;/a&gt;, a software company focused on team development, did a survey in 2018 with a similar result: they surveyed 1182 managers and 838 employees, and found that 89% of the managers and 73% of the employees said that one-on-ones positively affected a team’s performance. However, 40% of employees think their manager isn’t prepared for one-on-one meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engagement-through-dialogue&quot;&gt;Engagement through dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing dialogue creates engagement. Dialogue is an opportunity for managers to show they care about their team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Don Clifton in the book &lt;em&gt;First, Break All the Rules: What the world’s Greatest Managers Do Differently&lt;/em&gt;, caring is one of the twelve key items to measure the strength of a workplace. But to show they care, managers need to listen to employees’ answers. Kurt Deenan, a Gallup consultant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/147749/value-conversations-employees.aspx&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “managers need to listen to their employees, not just talk at their team. Managers create a sense of engagement through conversation.” Communication problems are often the cause of why teams have a low perception of how much their opinion counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does not necessarily need to happen in a formal one-on-one meeting. It may happen through serendipitous encounters. Managers need to be listening all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one-on-one meetings are remarkable to gauge an employee’s sense of connection and set expectations. It’s a suitable way to know the person’s strengths, thus making it easier to match their talents to a role and increasing performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-conduct-a-one-on-one-meeting&quot;&gt;How to conduct a one-on-one meeting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;block-your-schedule&quot;&gt;Block your schedule&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the frequency you hold one-on-one meetings vary according to the size of the team, the experience of the employees or even the distance in the org chart (it’s unlikely the CTO will hold as many one-on-ones with the developers as their direct managers will), it’s important to keep them recurring. Experiment with the frequency, but do not cancel the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-prepared&quot;&gt;Be prepared&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s your employees’ meeting, they should bring a list of points to discuss, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be prepared. In the ideal scenario, both of you would work jointly on an agenda, but in case that’s not possible, write down your own list too. Compare the lists, prioritize and make sure you cover the most critical issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-present&quot;&gt;Be present&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn off your notifications and close your notebook. If it’s in a remote environment, block off distractions, let your video call software fullscreen and pay attention. The only exception is if you agree with your employee you’re taking notes in the meeting. That being so, split the screen with only your video call software and your note-taking application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-not-use-it-as-a-status-report-meeting&quot;&gt;Do not use it as a status report meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use one-on-one meetings to solve problems, but keep it as a more strategic problem-solving. It’s not a status report meeting, if you need to learn the status of some task, use a work management software (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pipefy.com&quot;&gt;Pipefy&lt;/a&gt;) and check there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ask-open-ended-questions&quot;&gt;Ask open-ended questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good open-ended questions lead to substantial answers. A “how are you?” question seems vague, try instead asking specific questions with open-end answers. For instance, “what’s the favorite part of what you do and what’s the least desirable one?” followed by a “why is that so?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important you keep a record of the meetings so you don’t miss anything. If you constantly miss what your employee is saying, you send the wrong message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several tools that can assist in your one-on-one meeting. You can keep a shared document on Google Docs or other office tools (remember you can also have your private notes), but you can also take advantage of your work management tool. Using Pipefy, you can set up a one-on-one pipe (there’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pipefy.com/templates/one-one-meeting/&quot;&gt;template&lt;/a&gt; for that) to keep track of every meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the office, it’s easier to have water cooler chats and serendipitous encounters where you can start building relationships with the team. In a remote environment, we need to rely on other methods to build those connections. One-on-one meetings are one of those ways and it’s highly associated with the effectiveness of a manager by their employees. There’s no exact formula for a successful meeting, but some simple rules make it more fruitful. Engage the team and see a boost in productivity and morale.

Meetups&lt;/a&gt;. Every once in a while someone either
from Movile or outside (for now, we had only two talks and both were from
Movile employees) presents something and it’s open for the local community to
participate, not only Movile employees. The talk usually lasts for forty
minutes, then there’s a Q&amp;amp;A session and finally we go to the Recharging Area
(our kitchen) to eat pizza, drink beer and soda and talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first meetup was about Apple Watch, presented by two people: Marcel Müller,
an amazing designer, and Guilherme Sampaio, great iOS developer. That set the
bar high for the next meetup, presented by yours truly, about Android Wear.
I decided to follow the same format, the first half about design and the last
half about programming. Wait, a programmer talking about design? Well, there
are some design principles that everyone developing something user-facing needs
to know and I could talk about that. Fortunately, Google licensed Android
documentation as Creative Commons, so I could use the images (and credit them,
of course) and I didn’t have to make my own artwork. See the presentation in
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cafelinear.com/talks&quot;&gt;talks page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really excited about the talk and I think I could show my excitement.
I tend to consider my talks bad, but from the reaction of the public, it wasn’t
so bad afterall, they laughed and they asked a LOT of questions (I love when
people do that, someday I’ll try a Q&amp;amp;A only talk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the demo to work, I was with my Linux box, and
the emulator refused to work. I’ll prepare a video and share later this week (I
expected to this today, but I didn’t finish it yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I enjoyed the event. It was well organized, I met new people, and
showed some friends where I work (I’m proud to work at Movile). If you want to
join and develop great apps in an awesome team, we’re

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-best-path-for-learning-Android-app-development-I-have-a-good-knowledge-of-Java-but-no-understanding-of-XML/&quot;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;
how to learn Android development. The person had knowledge of Java, but none of
XML. I suppose the fear of XML came from the fact that is well known that
Android uses a lot of XML. I started with a quick clarification on XML syntax
and that’s the only required knowledge of XML. The parsing is done
automatically by the Android system or the build tools. Unless, of course, the
person is writing a XML parser or using one (e.g., parsing a response from
a server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re afraid of XML because layouts and resources are specified in XML in
Android, here’s everything you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax is a lot similar to HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is case-sensitive: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;application&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is different from
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Application&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so pay attention (most of Android tags are camel cased, but
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is all lower, for example).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attributes must be quoted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:background=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and not 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:background=#FFFFFF&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags can’t be interleaved: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is valid,
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bbb&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags must be closed: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; needs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or it must be single tag: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Namespaces in attributes come before colon: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:id=&quot;⋯&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (this is
using attribute id from android namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you’re developing a parser, or you’re writing XML extensively,
you need a lot more. This is just to get started in Android. Now you’re set to
go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of books teaching Android. I learned back in 2010 from this
book: 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1118102274/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1118102274&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Professional Android 4 Application Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-br.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=caflin-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=33&amp;amp;a=1118102274&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;
(although it was Android 2 that time) and also
from experimenting on. Some people find this book a little terse, I prefer
books like that, that goes straight to the point instead of wasting paper and
my time telling a lot of things unrelated or just to make the text dumb proof.
Recently I got a copy of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/0321804333/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321804333&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-br.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=caflin-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=33&amp;amp;a=0321804333&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;
and it’s nice too. If you manage to finish the book, congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B00BJOO6YW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BJOO6YW&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Android

&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to spend any money, don’t worry. The best source is still
&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android Developers&lt;/a&gt; site. Start here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/index.html&quot;&gt;Getting
Started&lt;/a&gt; and also read here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html&quot;&gt;Introduction to Android&lt;/a&gt;.  You
need nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When stuck, Google it. Don’t be the person that asks for help in the forums without searching before. If you’re stuck, look into Android developers group, Stack Overflow, Android developers Google+ community, your local group (for instance, in Brazil we have androidbrasil-dev and Stack Overflow in Portuguese). A note about Stack Overflow: don’t just copy an answer, try to understand it. If you’re still stuck, post your question, but tell which paths you already tried, be polite, patient and write in good English. I’m tired of reading “idk wat to do, app crash, help me” and I can bet most of other readers are tired too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, the most useful advice in this answer: practice, practice, practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: When I wrote this answer on Quora, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853&quot;&gt;Android
Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; course on Udacity wasn’t
available. But I cannot write about Android resources nowadays without
recommending it, it’s quite nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas Drumond</name></author><category term="" /><summary type="html">A while ago someone asked on Quora how to learn Android development.

and discuss whatever comes to mind (most of the time it’s Android, the
preferred topic for most of the attendees), but this month we decided to do
something different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organized by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/karuanbertoluci&quot;&gt;Karuan Bertoluci&lt;/a&gt;, this
month meeting was a series of three talks hosted at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ciandt.com/us-en/&quot;&gt;Ci&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, which provided the venue and some
beverage and food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Karuan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRUbb2xtmv8&quot;&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; the event,
I gave the first talk on Android Wear. You can watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWjVfn5zdPM&quot;&gt;on
YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and download the slides
from &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/android-wear&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differently from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/mobcamp-2014-android-wear-and-google-glass&quot;&gt;previous
talk&lt;/a&gt;,
I decided to something more technical and dive into code. In the end, I tried
to do some demo, but, as a lot of demos, I had some problems pairing my phone
with the emulator under Ci&amp;amp;T WiFi network and I had to cut the demo to
watch-only apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thaleslima/&quot;&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/103096424877927954687/posts&quot;&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, from Ci&amp;amp;T, talked
about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_BJPxfo1BY&quot;&gt;mobile backend development with Google
Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. He discussed several
aspects of Google Cloud Platform. I’d like to point out his Firebase demo, that
was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finaly, for the last talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+CaioOcchini&quot;&gt;Caio
Occhini&lt;/a&gt;, from Google, talked about
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmTfxltHYp4&quot;&gt;monetization options for mobile
apps&lt;/a&gt;. He explained AdMob and
other forms of monetization, like In-app Billing, and also covered Google
Analytics to show how developers can watch for metrics to better increase
conversion (leading to more money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nice event, the room was packed and, despite the time, most of the
people stayed until the end. Due to its acceptance, I’m looking forward to do
more events like that for bringing Campinas developer community together.&lt;/p&gt;
