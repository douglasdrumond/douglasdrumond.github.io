&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give at least 10 talks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 2 of them outside São Paulo State&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At least 1 of them outside southeast region&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a super goal, give one international talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not impossible, but it’s a little bit hard to achieve and these talks need
to be high quality talks (of course). Thinking it’s a little bit less than one
talk a month, it sounds feasible, but a lot of events tend to occur in the same
month or near each other, which means several months free and some months with
3 or 4 talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have other goals for doing more for the community, but I’ll talk about them
later, when I have more solid plans.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas Drumond</name></author><category term="" /><summary type="html">I love developer communities.

Meetups&lt;/a&gt;. Every once in a while someone either
from Movile or outside (for now, we had only two talks and both were from
Movile employees) presents something and it’s open for the local community to
participate, not only Movile employees. The talk usually lasts for forty
minutes, then there’s a Q&amp;amp;A session and finally we go to the Recharging Area
(our kitchen) to eat pizza, drink beer and soda and talk to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first meetup was about Apple Watch, presented by two people: Marcel Müller,
an amazing designer, and Guilherme Sampaio, great iOS developer. That set the
bar high for the next meetup, presented by yours truly, about Android Wear.
I decided to follow the same format, the first half about design and the last
half about programming. Wait, a programmer talking about design? Well, there
are some design principles that everyone developing something user-facing needs
to know and I could talk about that. Fortunately, Google licensed Android
documentation as Creative Commons, so I could use the images (and credit them,
of course) and I didn’t have to make my own artwork. See the presentation in
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cafelinear.com/talks&quot;&gt;talks page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really excited about the talk and I think I could show my excitement.
I tend to consider my talks bad, but from the reaction of the public, it wasn’t
so bad afterall, they laughed and they asked a LOT of questions (I love when
people do that, someday I’ll try a Q&amp;amp;A only talk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I couldn’t get the demo to work, I was with my Linux box, and
the emulator refused to work. I’ll prepare a video and share later this week (I
expected to this today, but I didn’t finish it yet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, I enjoyed the event. It was well organized, I met new people, and
showed some friends where I work (I’m proud to work at Movile). If you want to
join and develop great apps in an awesome team, we’re

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-best-path-for-learning-Android-app-development-I-have-a-good-knowledge-of-Java-but-no-understanding-of-XML/&quot;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;
how to learn Android development. The person had knowledge of Java, but none of
XML. I suppose the fear of XML came from the fact that is well known that
Android uses a lot of XML. I started with a quick clarification on XML syntax
and that’s the only required knowledge of XML. The parsing is done
automatically by the Android system or the build tools. Unless, of course, the
person is writing a XML parser or using one (e.g., parsing a response from
a server).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my answer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re afraid of XML because layouts and resources are specified in XML in
Android, here’s everything you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax is a lot similar to HTML.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is case-sensitive: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;application&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is different from
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Application&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so pay attention (most of Android tags are camel cased, but
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is all lower, for example).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attributes must be quoted &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:background=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and not 
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:background=#FFFFFF&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags can’t be interleaved: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is valid,
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;bbb&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/bbb&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tags must be closed: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; needs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/aaa&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or it must be single tag: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aaa /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Namespaces in attributes come before colon: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;⋯ android:id=&quot;⋯&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (this is
using attribute id from android namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you’re developing a parser, or you’re writing XML extensively,
you need a lot more. This is just to get started in Android. Now you’re set to
go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of books teaching Android. I learned back in 2010 from this
book: 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1118102274/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1118102274&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Professional Android 4 Application Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-br.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=caflin-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=33&amp;amp;a=1118102274&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;
(although it was Android 2 that time) and also
from experimenting on. Some people find this book a little terse, I prefer
books like that, that goes straight to the point instead of wasting paper and
my time telling a lot of things unrelated or just to make the text dumb proof.
Recently I got a copy of 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/0321804333/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0321804333&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://ir-br.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=caflin-20&amp;amp;l=as2&amp;amp;o=33&amp;amp;a=0321804333&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&quot; /&gt;
and it’s nice too. If you manage to finish the book, congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later you can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/B00BJOO6YW/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00BJOO6YW&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=caflin-20&quot;&gt;Android

&lt;p&gt;But if you don’t want to spend any money, don’t worry. The best source is still
&lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/&quot;&gt;Android Developers&lt;/a&gt; site. Start here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/training/index.html&quot;&gt;Getting
Started&lt;/a&gt; and also read here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html&quot;&gt;Introduction to Android&lt;/a&gt;.  You
need nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When stuck, Google it. Don’t be the person that asks for help in the forums without searching before. If you’re stuck, look into Android developers group, Stack Overflow, Android developers Google+ community, your local group (for instance, in Brazil we have androidbrasil-dev and Stack Overflow in Portuguese). A note about Stack Overflow: don’t just copy an answer, try to understand it. If you’re still stuck, post your question, but tell which paths you already tried, be polite, patient and write in good English. I’m tired of reading “idk wat to do, app crash, help me” and I can bet most of other readers are tired too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, the most useful advice in this answer: practice, practice, practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: When I wrote this answer on Quora, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853&quot;&gt;Android
Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt; course on Udacity wasn’t
available. But I cannot write about Android resources nowadays without
recommending it, it’s quite nice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas Drumond</name></author><category term="" /><summary type="html">A while ago someone asked on Quora how to learn Android development.

a script to move assets from iOS style naming to Android drawable folders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I do some UI work on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; or
interact with designers who work with this tool. When it exports assets, it
uses the iOS naming convention of adding @2x or @3x to the file name. It’s
possible to add intermediate resolutions for export, and it creates a file with
@1.5x in name, and, for higher resolutions, it uses @4x. These sizes correspond
to Android mdpi to xxxhdpi sizes. There should be some plugin to export
correctly for Android, but I was bored at home and decided to create a script
for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, I was working at Movile and the designer hadn’t yet finished our
Android assets, but he had finished working on the iOS design. To avoid being
blocked I decided to use the iOS assets we already had (later it would be just
a copy over to fix it) that were close enough to our Android UI. I remembered
my script and used it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A colleague was in the same situation and I showed him my scripted. He used it,
I had to adjust some things (even in this small script there was a bug), it
worked and I forgot about it. Then someday I was in the Recharging Area (our
kitchen) when a designer thanked me for the script. She used it to simplify her
workflow. That was when I realized this should be useful for more people,
despite being extremely crude.&lt;/p&gt;

month meeting was a series of three talks hosted at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ciandt.com/us-en/&quot;&gt;Ci&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, which provided the venue and some
beverage and food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Karuan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRUbb2xtmv8&quot;&gt;opened&lt;/a&gt; the event,
I gave the first talk on Android Wear. You can watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWjVfn5zdPM&quot;&gt;on
YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and download the slides
from &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/android-wear&quot;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Differently from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/mobcamp-2014-android-wear-and-google-glass&quot;&gt;previous
talk&lt;/a&gt;,
I decided to something more technical and dive into code. In the end, I tried
to do some demo, but, as a lot of demos, I had some problems pairing my phone
with the emulator under Ci&amp;amp;T WiFi network and I had to cut the demo to
watch-only apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following my talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thaleslima/&quot;&gt;Thales&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/103096424877927954687/posts&quot;&gt;Lima&lt;/a&gt;, from Ci&amp;amp;T, talked
about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_BJPxfo1BY&quot;&gt;mobile backend development with Google
Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. He discussed several
aspects of Google Cloud Platform. I’d like to point out his Firebase demo, that
was great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finaly, for the last talk, &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+CaioOcchini&quot;&gt;Caio
Occhini&lt;/a&gt;, from Google, talked about
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmTfxltHYp4&quot;&gt;monetization options for mobile
apps&lt;/a&gt;. He explained AdMob and
other forms of monetization, like In-app Billing, and also covered Google
Analytics to show how developers can watch for metrics to better increase
conversion (leading to more money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a nice event, the room was packed and, despite the time, most of the
people stayed until the end. Due to its acceptance, I’m looking forward to do
more events like that for bringing Campinas developer community together.&lt;/p&gt;

with it. It was early morning, I published it at 7:30 AM (UTC-3) and went to
work. Of course, being an avid user of Vim, the first thing I did at work was
updating my copy of MacVim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then things went awry. MacVim crashed at launch (of course, it didn’t occur at
home). E-mails started popping on my inbox. Starting without a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/code&gt; was
fine, so it was a problem with plugins.  Probably I had compiled it against
wrong version of Ruby (I use RVM and install several Ruby versions, but MacVim
must be compiled against system Ruby), but I was quite sure I had issued a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rvm
use system&lt;/code&gt; before. When I came back home, I tried to investigate a little
further and, as I suspected, it was Ruby (it crashed when I used Command-T
plugin). But how? Well, I was so tired that I went to bed and decided to look
at the issue later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Movile, my project is on a tight deadline, so, every time I got home, I was
so tired that I couldn’t focus. I tried, but postponed looking at the issue
(also, sometimes I tried but hit a dead end). Until, finally, last weekend
I decided to solve this matter. But first, my Mac was so slow and with a lot of
garbage installed that, instead of deleting each app and some files, I backed
up what was important and did something I was used to when I was a Windows
user: formatting the computer and reinstalling the OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a new OS, lots of disk space (even after installing some apps, I went from 10
 GB free to 80 GB), it was time to fix MacVim. I recompiled and ran it to
 collect logs and, guess what? It worked flawlessly, even with Command-T.
 I hadn’t installed RVM (still haven’t) and MacVim used system Ruby (some day
 earlier, I made sure I was compiling after &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rvm use system&lt;/code&gt;, but it didn’t
 work, it just got me some logs in Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports). I uploaded
 the build, marked as pre-release and went to work. MacVim worked flawlessly
 again, even on my work machine. People who complained about the bug sent me
 feedback telling that everything was fine now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, even setting RVM to use system Ruby, MacVim was compiled against the wrong
 version of Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned: be careful and doubt everything. I sincerely apologize for
 being careless in my first release. I felt the pain as a user too, I upgraded
 and downgraded (as other users had to) because of my own carelessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lesson learned: MacVim community is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Douglas Drumond</name></author><category term="open-source" /><category term="MacVim" /><category term="Open source" /><summary type="html">I published a new version of MacVim on last week Monday and was quite happy with it.

Although I can use it in the terminal, I like
to have a nice UI to look at and when I’m on a Mac (e.g., at work), I use MacVim. I
have no words to thank the amazing job behind both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/macvim&quot;&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; and I always
wanted to contribute back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been building MacVim for older versions of Mac since 2012 and since Björn has
been busy, I’m maintaining it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as soon as I took the job, things at work got busier, I already had
other things to finish (and I did it) and MacVim got Ctrl-Z’d. Finally, I did it.
I’m back on track and, with this, MacVim is back on track too.&lt;/p&gt;
