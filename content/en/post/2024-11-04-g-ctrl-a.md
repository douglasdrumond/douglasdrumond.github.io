In Vim, you can type `ctrl-a` or `ctrl-x` to increment or decrement the next
number in the line. For example, suppose you have the following line:
```
1. Do something
```
If you put the cursor on number one and type `ctrl-a` repeated times, you notice
the number will increase to 2, 3, etc. Similarly, if you type `ctrl-x`, it will decrease
going into negative numbers if you do it enough times.

Let's say you want to create a numbered list. You have a list of people:
```
Ana
Daniel
Douglas
Fabiane
Marina
Letícia
Pedro
```

You used the [tip about `:normal` command]({{< relref "2024-11-04-vim-norm-command" >}}) to insert a number
to insert a number at the beginning of the lines:

```
0. Ana
0. Daniel
0. Douglas
0. Fabiane
0. Marina
0. Letícia
0. Pedro
```

Now you want to change those noughts to 1-7. You can go to the first line, type
`ctrl-a`, go to the second line, type `ctrl-a` twice, go to the third line,
type `ctrl-a` three times and so on. But that is annoying. Instead, visually
select all numbers (using `ctrl-v`), then type `g` followed by `ctrl-a`. It
will automatically change the first line to 1, the second to 2, and so on.

```
1. Ana
2. Daniel
3. Douglas
4. Fabiane
5. Marina
6. Letícia
7. Pedro
```

This tip also works with `ctrl-x` to decrease the numbers.
