If you want to execute a command on all lines matching a pattern, you
can use the Ex command `:g`. For example, if you want to delete all
blank lines, you can do
```
:g/^\s*$/d
```

It will get all lines that matches this: from the beginning (`^`), it may
contain 0 or more whitespace (`\s*`) until the end of line (`$`). In other
words, if the line is empty or contain only whitespace.

For all lines matching that criterium, delete it (`d`).

You can also execute commands on all lines **not** matching the pattern.
Instead of `g`, use `v`:

```
:v/^[a-z]\+:/d
```

That will delete all lines not starting with a lowercase word followed by
a colon.

Imagine this file:
```
title: Vim search
tags: ["vim", "regex"]
date: 2024-11-04

Some text.

More text.
```

All lines, except the first three, will be removed.
