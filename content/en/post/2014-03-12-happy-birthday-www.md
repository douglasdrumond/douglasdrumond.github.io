title: Happy Birthday, WWW
---

25 years ago, Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, read about it on
[Computer History
Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/happy-25th-birthday-to-the-world-wide-web/).

Seeing the pictures makes me nostalgic. I used WindowMaker when I started using
Linux in 1999 and it’s inspired by NeXTSTEP.

_Update:_

Another legendary Tim made a nice post:

(that’s Tim Bray, co-creator of XML).
