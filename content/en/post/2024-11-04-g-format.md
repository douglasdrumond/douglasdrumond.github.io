If you type a really long line in Vim, Vim soft-wraps it at the end of the
window, but in the file it's still one line. If you type `gq` or `gw` followed
by a movement, Vim formats the text based on the movement you selected. For
instance, `gwip` will format the paragraph under the cursor (`gw` inside `i`
paragraph `p`), `gwG` will format from the cursor to the end of the file (`G`).

Both `gw` and `gq` format the same way. However, `gw` keeps the cursor position
while `gq` does not.
