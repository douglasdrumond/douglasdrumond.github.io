title: MacVim is back on track
---

It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Vim. Although I can use it in the terminal, I like
to have a nice UI to look at and when I’m on a Mac (e.g., at work), I use MacVim. I
have no words to thank the amazing job behind both [Vim](http://www.vim.org) and 
[MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim) and I always
wanted to contribute back.

I’ve been building MacVim for older versions of Mac since 2012 and since Björn has
been busy, I’m maintaining it now. 

Unfortunately, as soon as I took the job, things at work got busier, I already had
other things to finish (and I did it) and MacVim got Ctrl-Z’d. Finally, I did it.
I’m back on track and, with this, MacVim is back on track too.
