title: Waza Opening
---

[Waza](https://waza.heroku.com/2013) is an event promoted by
[Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), a PaaS company. In
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) language world there is this tendency to name
things after Japanese words (Ruby itself came from Japan, thanks to Matsumoto
Yukihiro, a.k.a. Matz), although I have no idea if this influenced Heroku
somehow. Heroku itself I don’t think it’s a Japanese word (at least I couldn’t
find it in any dictionary I looked at). On the other hand, waza is a Japanese
word meanining technique, so it makes perfect sense to name an event focused on
technical knowledge after this word.

I practiced shodō (Japanese calligraphy) for a while, so when I watched Waza
opening, my first thought was “this is cool” and the second was Hero, the movie
with Jet Li about China’s unification under Qin dinasty (this movie shows
a huge writing much like the one in this opening, but it’s an old form of jiàn
劍, sword in Chinese).

So, here’s the video:
