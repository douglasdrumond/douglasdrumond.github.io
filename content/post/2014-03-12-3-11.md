title: "3.11"
---

Three years ago, on March 11th, a tsunami hit the east coast of Japan killing
19000 people and leaving many others homeless. Still today many of them can’t
return to their home due to radiation near Fukushima disaster. Yahoo!Japan had
a great initiative, donating 10 yen for each search for “3.11”

See the announcement:

There’s a YouTube channel, [Kizuna311](https://www.youtube.com/user/kizuna311),
with messages and videos dedicated to those who suffered on the disaster. It
starts with Watanabe Ken, known for The Last Samurai, Inception and Letters
from Iwo Jima. I watched this over and over:
