<p>Recently I watched a YouTube video from Ted Vieira, a well-known photographer among the Fujifilm community, titled Gear With Soul? He shows a magazine by KEH Camera with the tagline &ldquo;Gear with soul for people with vision&rdquo; and spends the video showing photos and talking about that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also an old video from DigitalRev TV where Kai Wong discusses what makes a Leica M unique. And the very last line is &ldquo;it got soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember being in a workshop and the instructor badmouthing Sony cameras saying &ldquo;they have no soul&rdquo;. A friend of mine joked &ldquo;of course not, they are cameras!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do some people say that some objects have souls? I have seen this also happening in motorcycle community and I found a pattern. Beware this is not a scientific study, everything is based only on anecdotal evidence. Both in motorcycle and photography community, it&rsquo;s usually related to old or at least old-style cameras or motorcycles. It makes me wonder if it&rsquo;s just a nostalgic feeling for people who lived in a bygone era or younger people who wished to live in that era or just people running away from the day-to-day rush and those objects remind them of a slow-paced time.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just baloney, but if you feel inspired by that, go ahead. Enjoy the way the camera feels in your hands, the lens, moving the focusing tab. Pretend you&rsquo;re Sebastião Salgado, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa and go have fun with your camera. Who knows what kind of photography you&rsquo;ll get in those unpretentious moments.</p>
