Way down among brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You can’t get cherry soda’cause they’ve got to sell that quota
And the way things are I’ll bet they never will
They’ve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil">

<p>Way down among brazilians<br>
Coffee beans grow by the billions<br>
So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill<br>
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil<br>
You can’t get cherry soda’cause they’ve got to sell that quota<br>
And the way things are I’ll bet they never will<br>
They’ve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil</p>
<p>No tea or tomato juice<br>
You’ll see no potato juice<br>
Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no</p>
<p>The politician’s daughter<br>
Was accused of drinking water<br>
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill<br>
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil</p>
<p>No tea or tomato juice<br>
You’ll see no potato juice</p>
<p>And when their ham and eggs need savor<br>
Coffee ketchup gives ’em flavor<br>
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill<br>
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil</p>
<p>No tea or tomato juice<br>
You’ll see no potato juice<br>
Cause the planters down in santos all say no no no</p>
<p>So your lead to the local color<br>
Serving coffee with a cruller<br>
Dunking doesn’t take a lot of skill<br>
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> since first publication, original embedded video has become
unavailable, that is another video, but the same song.</p>
