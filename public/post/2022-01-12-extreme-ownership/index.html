my job better. He referred me to a book, Extreme Ownership, by Jocko Willink
and Leif Babin.</p>
<p>The book’s main idea is to take ownership of everything you do (or don’t do),
especially for a leader. If a team fails, the leader should step up and
assume the failure instead of blaming the team.</p>
<p>But this idea is relevant for individual contributors too. Instead of blaming
others, look at what you could have done better to prevent the situation.
Instead of “the budget approved by C-level wasn’t reasonable”, think of “what
can I do with this budget and how can I bring visibility of possible
shortcomings?” Instead of “the tasks are not well described”, think of “what
questions can I ask to clarify the requirements?”</p>
<p>And when a problem arises, do not point fingers. Assume the failure, learn
from it and create an action plan to do better next time.</p>
<p>Extreme ownership is not an excuse to be dumb, though. If you’re innocent,
don’t take the blame for something illegal. Those infringing the law must
face the consequences, not you.</p>
<p>Next time you face an issue, instead of pointing fingers, try this exercise:
ask yourself, “what could I have done to prevent this?” And act on the
conclusion. You’ll notice that, after a while, you’ll earn more trust from
your team, peers and leaders.</p>
