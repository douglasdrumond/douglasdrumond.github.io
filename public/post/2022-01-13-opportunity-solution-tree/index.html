ended up with too many ideas that you had to aggressively trim down or, worse,
you solved the wrong problem? Opportunity Solution Tree may help you avoid
that.</p>
<p>Opportunity Solution Tree (let&rsquo;s shorten it to OST) is a visual way to
represent how the solutions connect to the desired outcome in a way that helps
you focus on solving the right problem.</p>
<p>You can build an OST in 4 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the outcome, e.g., a metric you want to improve. Example: improve
engagement on Twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find opportunities related to your desired outcome. Example: build
relationships with other creators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brainstorm the solutions with one condition: the solutions should always be
linked to one of the opportunities from the previous step. Example: comment
on other people&rsquo;s tweets. An example of what not to do: start another
account in another social network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define experiments to validate your hypothesis. Example: engage with at
least 3 other creators per day for two weeks and compare how received likes,
retweets and followers changed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that in step 2 you may find more than one opportunity, thus in step 3
you create solutions for several opportunities, increase the options to
multi-track, i.e., act on more than one opportunity at a time. You don&rsquo;t fixate
on one opportunity. However, you&rsquo;re always connected to your goal.</p>
<p>Reframing the ideation process using the OST framework allow you to find
solutions without going off course or creating too much noise. Give it a try.</p>
