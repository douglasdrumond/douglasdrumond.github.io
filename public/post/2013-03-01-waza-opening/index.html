<a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, a PaaS company. In
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> language world there is this tendency to name
things after Japanese words (Ruby itself came from Japan, thanks to Matsumoto

<p>I practiced shodō (Japanese calligraphy) for a while, so when I watched Waza
opening, my first thought was “this is cool” and the second was Hero, the movie
with Jet Li about China’s unification under Qin dinasty (this movie shows
a huge writing much like the one in this opening, but it’s an old form of jiàn
劍, sword in Chinese).</p>
<p>So, here’s the video:</p>
