      <p>Do you struggle to learn different topics or keep different subjects in your head while you are working on some project? Well, me too. I have ADHD. I have multiple interests. When I hyperfocus on one of my interests, time flies. But usually, I need to learn different subjects and make them work together on a project. And I bet you need that, too. How can you solve it? One technique I use for studying different topics and making them work together is the Zettelkasten method. And you will learn how to leverage it to improve your learning.</p>

<p>I opened MacVim to tell a personal story.</p>
<p>The year was 1998, I was 15. I told my dad I wanted to go to a certification
program. It&rsquo;s something familiar in Brazil; you have high school courses and
earn a certificate in parallel. I was inclined to study Chemistry (I really
enjoyed the subject back then), but someone had suggested Informatics, and it
looked promising. One problem: I didn&rsquo;t have a computer and had no money to buy
one. My dad said: &ldquo;choose that one; we&rsquo;ll figure it out.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The iPad is a useful tool. I have two, the ginormous 12.9‚Äù iPad Pro and an iPad
mini, and I enjoy both. Each has its use case.</p>
<p>The Pro is used for consuming videos, photo editing, reading photography
magazines and books, writing, and other activities that benefit from a large
screen and, sometimes, a calibrated screen, such as when you enable the
reference mode in settings.</p>
<p>The mini is used for quick consumption here and there. I occasionally watch
videos on it, read books on Apple Books or even on the Kindle app, browse news,
read my feeds, etc.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine shared with me two talks on different processes leading to creativity. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K4YcaU5uqU">2016 TEDx talk</a> by futurist Stephan Schwartz and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjYrxcGSWX4">2019 TED talk</a> by author Tim Harford. While Stephan Schwartz presents a process divided into six steps to induce creativity, Tim Harford shows a different method, much more diverse in approach. Comparing both processes, they seem conflicting; however, when analysing more closely, they complement each other.</p>
<p>Schwartz argues that by looking at the diaries of other creative genii from the past, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Picasso, Einstein, Pauli, Planck, etc., to understand how they managed to produce so much stuff, we can distil it to a six-step process:</p>

      <p>When I first got a leadership role, I asked a friend for tips to learn and do

<p>The book‚Äôs main idea is to take ownership of everything you do (or don‚Äôt do),
especially for a leader. If a team fails, the leader should step up and
assume the failure instead of blaming the team.</p>

<p>That quote refers to the evolution of the species, but we can bring it to the corporate environment, especially in the startup world. Companies pivot. Companies fail. Companies merge and get acquired‚Äîthe culture of the company changes. For better or for worse, but it won‚Äôt stay the same. Some people can‚Äôt accept that. It‚Äôs ok to dislike the change and move to another company. People have different preferences and are suited to different environments.
