This is old, but I think it’s so funny and propelling to study I feel I must share it.
This video was made by a colleague, John Cohn, at IBM as a contest for choosing
best video to encourage young people to go into engineering and computer
science. He made it for fun, since he couldn’t take part at contest as he was
organizing it, but he felt it would be good to create something to use as
example. Since engineering and computer science are deeply related to math, it
fits in here as well. He’s an “IBM Fellow, Mad Scientist and cast member
of Discovery Channel’s post-apocalyptic survival show ‘The Colony’”. And
he has great taste for shirts :)">
