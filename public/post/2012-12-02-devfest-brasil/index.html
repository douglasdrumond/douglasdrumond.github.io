Portuguese)</em></a>. Since Google won’t promote
Google Developer Day anymore, the Google Developer Groups (former GTUG,
Google Technology User Groups) are promoting DevFest. So, these events,
instead of being backed up by a big company, are from community to

<h2 id="the-critics">The critics</h2>
<p>When I submitted my talk, there was a field to put a summary of the
talk. I thought it would be online (as every talk in every event), but
no, they just put the title in a calendar. So, a lot of people went to
my talk having no idea what it was about. Is it my fault for not using a
better title? Yes, but I would put a straightforward title if I knew the
summary wouldn’t be used.</p>
<h2 id="googlers">Googlers</h2>
<p>Renato Mangini talk was very nice. He skimmed on several HTML5 topics
pointing to other talks that would dig deeper afterwards.</p>
<p>Neto Marin talked about Android. For me, it wasn’t a very nice talk. He
rushed through it, he put way more slides than the time slot allowed
and, in fact, I could read the slides without him explaining.</p>
<p>Lastly, Jeremy Walker’s codelab wasn’t in fact a codelab. He showed a
bunch of code, but we didn’t develop anything together. The organization
asked us to bring notebooks to codelabs, it wasn’t necessary. It
was very like my own talk, when I showed some code, but we didn’t
develop anything together (in my case, it was impossible due to time
constraints).</p>
<h2 id="non-googlers">Non-googlers</h2>
<p>I watched only one talk from a non-googler: “Desenvolvendo interfaces
total-flex” <em>(Developing total-flex interfaces)</em> by Daniel Filho. It
was the last talk before lunch, mine was first after lunch, so I left
thinking “there’s no way I’ll be as cool as him.” He talked about
flexible interfaces using CSS 3 and looked like he really knew the
subject for years although he said he learned it for the talk.</p>
<h2 id="my-talk">My talk</h2>
<p>I talked about Android internals. It was for beginners wanting to
familiarize with Android source and maybe compile their own build. I
started talking about Android SDK Reference Search, a Chrome extension.
With it, one can starting poking the code on classes of interest while
browsing documentation. Later, supposing they’re interested in digging
down the rabbit hole, I explained the required setup and how to get
started. Then I showed what was necessary to add an app to a build (so
the app becomes a system app, such as SMS app or calendar app).</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>Very nice. Nice space, nice food (well, I missed coffee), talks on time,
nice support for speakers, everything went fine.</p>
<h2 id="fun-at-the-end">Fun at the end</h2>
<p>In the end of the day, they raffled some prizes, such as some Android
courses from Globalcode, some Android themed backpacks, T-shirts and
the big prize: a Samsung Galaxy Note (if I recall correctly, it was a
Samsung Galaxy Note II). At first, they gave the T-shirts based on a
random number generator and counting the rows and people. Later they
just threw the T-shirts and people tried to catch them. I didn’t even
try, several taller people in front of me, but one T-shirt bounced at
the roof and fell almost in my lap, so I luckily caught one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was the first DevFest and it was worth the R$44 (approximately US$
20). Next year I intend to participate again and submit another talk as
well.</p>
