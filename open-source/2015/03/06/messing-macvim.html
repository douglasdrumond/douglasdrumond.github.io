        <p>I published a new version of MacVim on last week Monday and was quite happy
with it. It was early morning, I published it at 7:30 AM (UTC-3) and went to
work. Of course, being an avid user of Vim, the first thing I did at work was
updating my copy of MacVim.</p>

<p>Then things went awry. MacVim crashed at launch (of course, it didn’t occur at
home). E-mails started popping on my inbox. Starting without a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.vimrc</code> was
fine, so it was a problem with plugins.  Probably I had compiled it against
wrong version of Ruby (I use RVM and install several Ruby versions, but MacVim
must be compiled against system Ruby), but I was quite sure I had issued a <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm
use system</code> before. When I came back home, I tried to investigate a little
further and, as I suspected, it was Ruby (it crashed when I used Command-T
plugin). But how? Well, I was so tired that I went to bed and decided to look
at the issue later.</p>

<p>At Movile, my project is on a tight deadline, so, every time I got home, I was
so tired that I couldn’t focus. I tried, but postponed looking at the issue
(also, sometimes I tried but hit a dead end). Until, finally, last weekend
I decided to solve this matter. But first, my Mac was so slow and with a lot of
garbage installed that, instead of deleting each app and some files, I backed
up what was important and did something I was used to when I was a Windows
user: formatting the computer and reinstalling the OS.</p>

<p>With a new OS, lots of disk space (even after installing some apps, I went from 10
 GB free to 80 GB), it was time to fix MacVim. I recompiled and ran it to
 collect logs and, guess what? It worked flawlessly, even with Command-T.
 I hadn’t installed RVM (still haven’t) and MacVim used system Ruby (some day
 earlier, I made sure I was compiling after <code class="highlighter-rouge">rvm use system</code>, but it didn’t
 work, it just got me some logs in Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports). I uploaded
 the build, marked as pre-release and went to work. MacVim worked flawlessly
 again, even on my work machine. People who complained about the bug sent me
 feedback telling that everything was fine now.</p>

<p>So, even setting RVM to use system Ruby, MacVim was compiled against the wrong
 version of Ruby.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: be careful and doubt everything. I sincerely apologize for
 being careless in my first release. I felt the pain as a user too, I upgraded
 and downgraded (as other users had to) because of my own carelessness.</p>

<p>Another lesson learned: MacVim community is awesome.</p>
