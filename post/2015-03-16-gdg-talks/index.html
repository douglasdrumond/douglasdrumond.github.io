and discuss whatever comes to mind (most of the time it’s Android, the
preferred topic for most of the attendees), but this month we decided to do
something different.</p>
<p>Organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/karuanbertoluci">Karuan Bertoluci</a>, this
month meeting was a series of three talks hosted at
<a href="http://www.ciandt.com/us-en/">Ci&amp;T</a>, which provided the venue and some
beverage and food.</p>
<p>After Karuan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRUbb2xtmv8">opened</a> the event,
I gave the first talk on Android Wear. You can watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWjVfn5zdPM">on
YouTube</a> and download the slides
from <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/android-wear">Speaker Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Differently from my <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/mobcamp-2014-android-wear-and-google-glass">previous
talk</a>,
I decided to something more technical and dive into code. In the end, I tried
to do some demo, but, as a lot of demos, I had some problems pairing my phone
with the emulator under Ci&amp;T WiFi network and I had to cut the demo to
watch-only apps.</p>
<p>Following my talk, <a href="https://github.com/thaleslima/">Thales</a>
<a href="https://plus.google.com/103096424877927954687/posts">Lima</a>, from Ci&amp;T, talked
about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_BJPxfo1BY">mobile backend development with Google
Cloud</a>. He discussed several
aspects of Google Cloud Platform. I&rsquo;d like to point out his Firebase demo, that
was great.</p>
<p>Finaly, for the last talk, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+CaioOcchini">Caio
Occhini</a>, from Google, talked about
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmTfxltHYp4">monetization options for mobile
apps</a>. He explained AdMob and
other forms of monetization, like In-app Billing, and also covered Google
Analytics to show how developers can watch for metrics to better increase
conversion (leading to more money).</p>
<p>It was a nice event, the room was packed and, despite the time, most of the
people stayed until the end. Due to its acceptance, I&rsquo;m looking forward to do
more events like that for bringing Campinas developer community together.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> all talks in Portuguese.</p>
