      For English language readers: in Brazil, programming competitions are not widespread, so some questions arose last week about Google Code Jam. In order to answer them, I wrote an e-mail that I’m now changing into a blog post.
Motivação Google Code Jam completa 10 anos em 2013. Numa das listas que participo, surgiram algumas dúvidas sobre o Google Code Jam e competições de programação em geral. Depois de escrever uma resposta completa, eu havia pensado em transformar em post para manter a referência online e, coincidentemente, me sugeriram isso na lista também.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Waza is an event promoted by Heroku, a PaaS company. In Ruby language world there is this tendency to name things after Japanese words (Ruby itself came from Japan, thanks to Matsumoto Yukihiro, a.k.a. Matz), although I have no idea if this influenced Heroku somehow. Heroku itself I don’t think it’s a Japanese word (at least I couldn’t find it in any dictionary I looked at). On the other hand, waza is a Japanese word meanining technique, so it makes perfect sense to name an event focused on technical knowledge after this word.

      Last Friday I went to DevFest Brasil (in Portuguese). Since Google won’t promote Google Developer Day anymore, the Google Developer Groups (former GTUG, Google Technology User Groups) are promoting DevFest. So, these events, instead of being backed up by a big company, are from community to community. I recognize the hassle that is promoting these, and I think the people from GDG-SP (São Paulo), GDG-BH (Belo Horizonte) and GDG-GO (Goiás) did a great job nonetheless.

      This year we won’t have Google Developer Day. Instead, Google Developer Groups are organizing their own events called DevFest. These are pretty much like Google Developer Day with some extras. For instance, in GDDs, we didn’t have codelabs with hands on, just 1h (approx) long talks about a variety of topics Google related.
One other thing that changed are the speakers. On GDD, all were Google Employees or invited by Google.

The trip The hackathon was held in São Paulo city at Academia Wayra, a startup incubator located in a very cool building with a nice view. It was the first time Pinheiros river looked nice.

      Recently I had to put a folder from my app repository into a separate repository on its own. The easiest way was just git init a new repo, copy the directory and git commit it, but I would lose all history up until the move. After fiddling with git and Stack Overflow, I found the solution.
Suppose the structure is like this:
All-in-one repo: * server * code.go * code2.go * iOS * code.

      Bash has built-in substitution. For simple tasks it’s easier than piping through sed:
text=&#34;hello world&#34; echo ${text/hello/ohayou} # prints ohayou world Be aware that just the first word is changed:
text=&#34;hello world hello&#34; echo ${text/hello/ohayou} # prints ohayou world hello To change all instances of a world, prepend the search pattern with another slash:
text=&#34;hello world hello&#34; echo ${text//hello/ohayou} # prints ohayou world ohayou Notice there are two slashes before hello, one as the separator and one prepending it.

        Eigenclass

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In Ruby, there’s the concept of eigenclasses, or singleton classes. These are classes implicitly defined when attaching methods to a single instance.
From Wikipedia:
Ruby is object-oriented: every data type is an object, including classes and types which many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and &ldquo;nil&rdquo;). Every function is a method. Named values (variables) always designate references to objects, not the objects themselves. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class).

Way down among brazilians
Coffee beans grow by the billions
So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil
You can’t get cherry soda’cause they’ve got to sell that quota
And the way things are I’ll bet they never will
