        Messing MacVim

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I published a new version of MacVim on last week Monday and was quite happy with it. It was early morning, I published it at 7:30 AM (UTC-3) and went to work. Of course, being an avid user of Vim, the first thing I did at work was updating my copy of MacVim.
Then things went awry. MacVim crashed at launch (of course, it didn’t occur at home). E-mails started popping on my inbox.

      It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Vim. Although I can use it in the terminal, I like to have a nice UI to look at and when I’m on a Mac (e.g., at work), I use MacVim. I have no words to thank the amazing job behind both Vim and MacVim and I always wanted to contribute back.
I’ve been building MacVim for older versions of Mac since 2012 and since Björn has been busy, I’m maintaining it now.

      25 years ago, Sir Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, read about it on Computer History Museum.
Seeing the pictures makes me nostalgic. I used WindowMaker when I started using Linux in 1999 and it’s inspired by NeXTSTEP.
Update:
Another legendary Tim made a nice post: https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2014/03/11/The-Web-is-25 (that’s Tim Bray, co-creator of XML).

      A while ago someone asked on Quora about some good ways to understand the AOSP. Although I don’t work with Android internals anymore, it was fun looking back into AOSP and finding some sources (no pun intended). Here’s my answer (edited for this blog):
Obviously, first go to AOSP site and follow the instructions to download the source.
Although outdated, take a look at Android Platform Developer’s Guide (it’s a copy of the old PDK, removed from Android site now).

      Proceeding with my sequence of posts about version control systems, I’ll explain my Git workflow. It’s quite simple, after set up, the day to day workflow is as follows:
get the latest information from remote server: git pull --ff-only create a new branch and switch to it: git checkout -b branch_name work, work, work, then commit: git commit go back to master: git checkout master check if there’s something new: git pull --ff-only merge my work back into master: git rebase branch_name upload the modifications to server: git push And since I reached the magic number seven, those are the seven steps.

      A while ago, Fábio Akita from AkitaOnRails.com launched the campaign “Beginners’s Friday” intended to help the new generation of developers coming today. I’m totally buying into this idea and this is the first post I’m doing in that direction with version control systems.
Version Control Systems What is a version control system? In the context of software development, a version control, revision control or source control system is a software designed to control changes to computer programs (as well as documents, sites and virtually whatever you want).

DevFestW is a series of community-led events that have technical sessions centered around Google developer technologies and platforms. DevFestW is focused specifically on bringing together women in the local developer community to teach, learn, code and network.
DevFestW Campinas DevFestWs were supposed to be held in March, but we had to postpone ours to yesterday (April 10th) because of some problems with location. Finally, we got a lot of support from Dextraining to promote the event, from food to location, to video cameras to record the event, so we decided to do it even so late.
