      A friend of mine shared with me two talks on different processes leading to creativity. A 2016 TEDx talk by futurist Stephan Schwartz and a 2019 TED talk by author Tim Harford. While Stephan Schwartz presents a process divided into six steps to induce creativity, Tim Harford shows a different method, much more diverse in approach. Comparing both processes, they seem conflicting; however, when analysing more closely, they complement each other.

      Have you ever tried to brainstorm ideas to find what to work on next? And you ended up with too many ideas that you had to aggressively trim down or, worse, you solved the wrong problem? Opportunity Solution Tree may help you avoid that.
Opportunity Solution Tree (let&rsquo;s shorten it to OST) is a visual way to represent how the solutions connect to the desired outcome in a way that helps you focus on solving the right problem.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      When I first got a leadership role, I asked a friend for tips to learn and do my job better. He referred me to a book, Extreme Ownership, by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.
The book’s main idea is to take ownership of everything you do (or don’t do), especially for a leader. If a team fails, the leader should step up and assume the failure instead of blaming the team.

      Does gear have a soul?
Recently I watched a YouTube video from Ted Vieira, a well-known photographer among the Fujifilm community, titled Gear With Soul? He shows a magazine by KEH Camera with the tagline &ldquo;Gear with soul for people with vision&rdquo; and spends the video showing photos and talking about that.
There&rsquo;s also an old video from DigitalRev TV where Kai Wong discusses what makes a Leica M unique. And the very last line is &ldquo;it got soul.

      “It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the most adaptable to change.” This quote is often misattributed to Charles Darwin (it first appeared in a speech by Leon C. Megginson in 1963).
That quote refers to the evolution of the species, but we can bring it to the corporate environment, especially in the startup world. Companies pivot. Companies fail. Companies merge and get acquired—the culture of the company changes.

      You can&rsquo;t simply gain trust by saying “trust me, I know what I&rsquo;m saying”, you have to earn it. Let&rsquo;s start discussing trust and then how to conduct one-on-one meetings to earn that trust.
Trust In The High Price of Mistrust, a book titled Bowling Alone, by Robert Putnam, is discussed and there are two parts I&rsquo;d like to quote as they relate to remote management:
“One key lesson we can derive from Bowling Alone is that the less we trust each other—something which is both a cause and consequence of declining community engagement—the more it costs us.

      Movile has a new initiative called Movile Meetups. Every once in a while someone either from Movile or outside (for now, we had only two talks and both were from Movile employees) presents something and it’s open for the local community to participate, not only Movile employees. The talk usually lasts for forty minutes, then there’s a Q&amp;A session and finally we go to the Recharging Area (our kitchen) to eat pizza, drink beer and soda and talk to each other.

      A while ago someone asked on Quora how to learn Android development. The person had knowledge of Java, but none of XML. I suppose the fear of XML came from the fact that is well known that Android uses a lot of XML. I started with a quick clarification on XML syntax and that&rsquo;s the only required knowledge of XML. The parsing is done automatically by the Android system or the build tools.

      Usually every month we have an informal meeting at GDG Campinas, where we gather and discuss whatever comes to mind (most of the time it’s Android, the preferred topic for most of the attendees), but this month we decided to do something different.
Organized by Karuan Bertoluci, this month meeting was a series of three talks hosted at Ci&amp;T, which provided the venue and some beverage and food.
After Karuan opened the event, I gave the first talk on Android Wear.
