Frank Steinhoff suggested this Sinatra’s song. It’s about coffee and Brazil and it would have arise in a coffee talk at IMECC’s coffee room.

Way down among brazilians  
Coffee beans grow by the billions  
So they’ve got to find those extra cups to fill  
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil  
You can’t get cherry soda’cause they’ve got to sell that quota  
And the way things are I’ll bet they never will  
They’ve got a zillion tons of coffee in Brazil  

No tea or tomato juice  
You’ll see no potato juice  
Cause the planters down in Santos all say no no no  

The politician’s daughter  
Was accused of drinking water  
And was fined a great big fifty dollar bill  
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil  

No tea or tomato juice  
You’ll see no potato juice  

And when their ham and eggs need savor  
Coffee ketchup gives ’em flavor  
Coffee pickles way outsell the dill  
Why they put coffee in the coffee in Brazil  

No tea or tomato juice  
You’ll see no potato juice  
Cause the planters down in santos all say no no no  

So your lead to the local color  
Serving coffee with a cruller  
Dunking doesn’t take a lot of skill  
They’ve got an awful lot of coffee in Brazil  

_Edit:_ since first publication, original embedded video has become
unavailable, that is another video, but the same song.
