I got myself into Unix (or Unix-like) world back in 1999 with Conectiva Red Hat
Linux Marumbi. What a tough time! None of my friends used Linux, I didn’t have
internet connection at home, I had to go to school, download every tutorial
I could find there and copy them to floppy disks to read at home. Result is
pretty obvious, I reinstalled Windows. But the damage was done, I was bitten by
FLOSS and I kept another partition with Linux. I kept dual booting until 2004,
my sophomore year, when I wiped out Windows and lived only with Linux at home.
I kept it this way until 2008, when I switched from a Unix-like system to
a Unix system (I bought my first Mac). Until today, my primary computer was
a Mac and eventually Linux on a virtual machine. Even when I worked at
[Eldorado Research Institute](http://www.eldorado.org.br/), I ssh’d into
a Linux box and did most of my work there. The Unix way, small programs doing
one thing very well and conected through pipes, with text travelling from here
to there, great tools, that editor, vim, where I could almost achieve nirvana…

But… Guess what… I’m done with it! Command line? Text interfaces? I want real
GUI. Mac has a nice interface, but it’s too limited. I’m going back to Windows.
Thanks to Bootcamp, I can install it on my Mac, so I don’t need to spent money
on another notebook right now. I’ll use my money first for buying a Windows
phone (yeah, I’m selling my Galaxy Nexus and my old iPhone 3GS). The only piece
of FLOSS I’ll use is Emacs. I’m trying to memorize all the shortcuts, and
I have a wrist splint to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome. I’ll give up
mantaining MacVim on Lion and Snow Leopard, Emacs is the way to go. And, of
course, Visual Studio. Sorry, Taiane, no more Douguitos.
