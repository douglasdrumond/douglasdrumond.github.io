Bash has built-in substitution. For simple tasks itâ€™s easier than piping through sed:

{% highlight bash %}
text="hello world"
echo ${text/hello/ohayou}   # prints ohayou world
{% endhighlight %}

Be aware that just the first word is changed:

{% highlight bash %}
text="hello world hello"
echo ${text/hello/ohayou}   # prints ohayou world hello
{% endhighlight %}

To change all instances of a world, prepend the search pattern with another slash:

{% highlight bash %}
text="hello world hello"
echo ${text//hello/ohayou}   # prints ohayou world ohayou
{% endhighlight %}

Notice there are two slashes before *hello*, one as the separator and one prepending it.
