I just uploaded the slides of my talk in DevFest Brasil. See link on this page
(if you’re on desktop, it should be on the right, if you’re on a smartphone,
it’s at the bottom). It’s exactly as I presented. Later today or tomorrow I’ll
add some presenter notes or some screenshots of the hands-on part.

_Edit: just see the talks page_
