Have you ever tried to brainstorm ideas to find what to work on next? And you
ended up with too many ideas that you had to aggressively trim down or, worse,
you solved the wrong problem? Opportunity Solution Tree may help you avoid
that.

Opportunity Solution Tree (let's shorten it to OST) is a visual way to
represent how the solutions connect to the desired outcome in a way that helps
you focus on solving the right problem.

You can build an OST in 4 steps:

1. Identify the outcome, e.g., a metric you want to improve. Example: improve
   engagement on Twitter.

2. Find opportunities related to your desired outcome. Example: build
   relationships with other creators.

3. Brainstorm the solutions with one condition: the solutions should always be
   linked to one of the opportunities from the previous step. Example: comment
   on other people's tweets. An example of what not to do: start another
   account in another social network.

4. Define experiments to validate your hypothesis. Example: engage with at
   least 3 other creators per day for two weeks and compare how received likes,
   retweets and followers changed.

Notice that in step 2 you may find more than one opportunity, thus in step 3
you create solutions for several opportunities, increase the options to
multi-track, i.e., act on more than one opportunity at a time. You don't fixate
on one opportunity. However, you're always connected to your goal.

Reframing the ideation process using the OST framework allow you to find
solutions without going off course or creating too much noise. Give it a try.
