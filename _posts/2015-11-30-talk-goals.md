I love developer communities. I'm an introvert and in developer communities
I can find my place. I also love to teach, specially when people are interested
in learning. That's why I present whenever possible ([7 talks in
2015]({{site.baseurl}}/talks), 2 aren't listed yet). But I want to increase
that, not just in volume, but also quality. I'm a huge fan of metrics (I work
for Movile and we're totally data driven) and I had already established some
goals for myself for 2016. Now, encouraged by Chiu-Ki and Kate from
[Technically
Speaking](http://tinyletter.com/techspeak/letters/technically-speaking-november-17-2015),
I want to share them:

* Give at least 10 talks
* At least 2 of them outside SÃ£o Paulo State
* At least 1 of them outside southeast region
* As a super goal, give one international talk.

It's not impossible, but it's a little bit hard to achieve and these talks need
to be high quality talks (of course). Thinking it's a little bit less than one
talk a month, it sounds feasible, but a lot of events tend to occur in the same
month or near each other, which means several months free and some months with
3 or 4 talks.

I have other goals for doing more for the community, but I'll talk about them
later, when I have more solid plans.
