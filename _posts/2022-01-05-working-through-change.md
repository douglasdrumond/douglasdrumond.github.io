_“It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the most adaptable to change.”_ This quote is often misattributed to Charles Darwin (it first appeared in a speech by Leon C. Megginson in 1963).

That quote refers to the evolution of the species, but we can bring it to the corporate environment, especially in the startup world. Companies pivot. Companies fail. Companies merge and get acquired—the culture of the company changes. For better or for worse, but it won’t stay the same. Some people can’t accept that. It’s ok to dislike the change and move to another company. People have different preferences and are suited to different environments. But if you’re resilient and can bear with the change, it can be an excellent opportunity to grow in your career.

It’s easy to perform well when everything is going well but harder to stick out because everyone is doing alright. On the other hand, when the company is going through change, and people start to complain, just show up and work. Of course, you can complain about the problems but use the proper channels. Chances are, your manager is also trying to avoid the dismantling of the team.

If you survive those challenging moments, you’re seen as reliable and may be assigned more responsibilities.

Is that the only way to grow or get more responsibilities? No. Are you wrong if you leave? Definitely no. No company is worth your mental health, and if it’s terrible for you, move on. Be true to yourself. You’re not better or worse if you stay or if you go. But while you’re there, do your best and try to get the best from the situation.
