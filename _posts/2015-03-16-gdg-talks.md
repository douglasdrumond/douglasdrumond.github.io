Usually every month we have a informal meeting at GDG Campinas, where we gather
and discuss whatever comes to mind (most of the time itâ€™s Android, the
preferred topic for most of the attendees), but this month we decided to do
something different.

Organized by [Karuan Bertoluci](https://twitter.com/karuanbertoluci), this
month meeting was a series of three talks hosted at
[Ci&T](http://www.ciandt.com/us-en/), which provided the venue and some
beverage and food.

After Karuan [opened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRUbb2xtmv8) the event,
I gave the first talk on Android Wear. You can watch it [on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWjVfn5zdPM) and download the slides
from [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/android-wear).

Differently from my [previous
talk](https://speakerdeck.com/douglasdrumond/mobcamp-2014-android-wear-and-google-glass),
I decided to something more technical and dive into code. In the end, I tried
to do some demo, but, as a lot of demos, I had some problems pairing my phone
with the emulator under Ci&T WiFi network and I had to cut the demo to
watch-only apps.

Following my talk, [Thales](https://github.com/thaleslima/)
[Lima](https://plus.google.com/103096424877927954687/posts), from Ci&T, talked
about [mobile backend development with Google
Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_BJPxfo1BY). He discussed several
aspects of Google Cloud Platform. I'd like to point out his Firebase demo, that
was great.

Finaly, for the last talk, [Caio
Occhini](https://plus.google.com/+CaioOcchini), from Google, talked about
[monetization options for mobile
apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmTfxltHYp4). He explained AdMob and
other forms of monetization, like In-app Billing, and also covered Google
Analytics to show how developers can watch for metrics to better increase
conversion (leading to more money).

It was a nice event, the room was packed and, despite the time, most of the
people stayed until the end. Due to its acceptance, I'm looking forward to do
more events like that for bringing Campinas developer community together.

_Note:_ all talks in Portuguese.
