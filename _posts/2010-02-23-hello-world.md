_Edit: In 2010 I and Daniel Cariello, one of my best friends, set up a blog
called Cafe Linear. This was our first post._

Searching for same happiness we had when talking about linear algebra
(sometimes, computational math too) at [IMECC](http://www.ime.unicamp.br)’s
cafe, drinking coffee (thank you Zefa), and, of course, standing Daniel’s wonderful
jokes \\( (N/m^{2}) \\), we present this blog. Virtually we may experience same 
joy and share a little of our (lack of) knowledge in math and C.S.

A quote from Alice in Wonderland that represents we authors and readers ;) :

>“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”  
>“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.  
>“I don’t much care where —” said Alice.  
>“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat  
>“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.  
>“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”  
>“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.  
>“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”

We’re glad you’re here. Enjoy the madness.
