It was early morning, I published it at 7:30 AM (UTC-3) and went to work. Of course, being an avid user of Vim, the first thing I did at work was updating my copy of MacVim.
Then things went awry. MacVim crashed at launch (of course, it didn’t occur at home). E-mails started popping on my inbox.</description></item><item><title>MacVim is back on track</title><link>https://www.douglasdrumond.tech/post/2015-02-23-MacVim-is-back-on-track.md/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.douglasdrumond.tech/post/2015-02-23-MacVim-is-back-on-track.md/</guid><description>It’s no secret I’m a big fan of Vim. Although I can use it in the terminal, I like to have a nice UI to look at and when I’m on a Mac (e.g., at work), I use MacVim. I have no words to thank the amazing job behind both Vim and MacVim and I always wanted to contribute back.
I’ve been building MacVim for older versions of Mac since 2012 and since Björn has been busy, I’m maintaining it now.</description></item></channel></rss>
