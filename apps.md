# Apps I developed or had some reasonable participation:

Since 2010 I've been working with Android. At first, I was employed at Eldorado
Research Institute and worked on platform code, not apps. Later I moved to app
development and at my current employer, Movile, it's basically what I do all
day.

Here's the list:

* [Bate-papo UOL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.uol.batepapo)  
  A chat app for UOL, one of the largest Brazilian portal.

* [UOL Copa](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.org.eldorado.uolcopa)  
  App developed for the World Cup in Brazil (also for UOL)

* [99motos](http://www.99motos.com/)  
  99motos is a courier calling app, like an Uber for courier. I was one of the
  developers of the first version. The current version on market has a very
  different interface, though (after the company was acquired).

* [Swipes](http://www.swipesapp.com)  
  Developed first Android version of Swipes, a To Do list app focused on quick
  management of tasks and ease of use.

* [Vivo Receitas da Dona Benta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.android.learning.donabenta)  
  [Vivo Saud√°vel com Dr.  Drauzio](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.android.learning.drauziovarella)  
  [Vivo Sucesso com Max Gehringer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.android.learning.maxgehringer)  
  Apps developed in partnership with Vivo, the largest carrier in Brazil, for
  content delivery based on some topics (recipes with the most famous recipe
  book in Brazil, health tips with one of the most well known physicians, and
  career tips, respectively).

* [Vivo +apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.android.appsvivo)  
  App selection and recommendation from friends.

* [Amei, Amiga](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.beauty)  
  Beauty app with mobile commerce.

* [Meu Show](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movile.vivomeushow)  
  Music contest via mobile app.
